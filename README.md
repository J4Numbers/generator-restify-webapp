# Restify webapp generator

A Yeoman generator for creating a Restify webserver. It currently comes with three modes of rendering:

* A GovUK rendering engine
* A Bootstrap rendering engine
* No rendering engine

## What gets generated?

## Installation and usage

> This package must be run from within the directory of the project you would like to generate.

For example, the following script would be the full set of commands for creating a new project with this framework:

```bash
mkdir my-new-project
cd my-new-project
git init && git commit --allow-empty -m "feat(initial): initial empty commit"
yo generator-restify-webapp
```

At this point, you can choose between all of the available options to install whichever flavour of the project you wish.
